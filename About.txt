Here is an example of creating a navigation bar using HTML and CSS:

Explanation:

We start by creating a navigation element using the <nav> tag.
Inside the navigation element, we create an unordered list using the <ul> tag.
Inside the unordered list, we create four list items using the <li> tag, each containing an anchor tag (<a>) for the links to the different pages.
In the CSS, we style the navigation bar by setting the background color, font size, and padding.
We then set the list-style to none, remove the margin and padding from the unordered list, and display the list items in a row using flexbox with space-between to distribute the space between the links evenly.
We also set a margin for the list items to add some space between them.
Finally, we set the color of the links to white and remove the underline using text-decoration: none.
You can customize the HTML and CSS to fit your specific needs and design preferences.
